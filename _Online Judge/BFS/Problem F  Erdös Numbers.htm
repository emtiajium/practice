Background</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The Hungarian Paul Erdös (1913-1996, speak as ``Ar-dish'') not only was one
of the strangest mathematicians of the 20th century, he was also one of the
most famous. He kept on publishing widely circulated papers up to a very high
age and every mathematician having the honor of being a
co-author to Erdös is well respected.

<p>
Not everybody got the chance to co-author a paper with Erdös, so many people
were content if they managed to publish a paper with somebody who had
published a scientific paper with Erdös. This gave rise to the 
so-called <em>Erdös numbers</em>. 
An author who has jointly published with Erdös had Erdös
number 1. An author who had not published with Erdös but with somebody with
Erdös number 1 obtained Erdös number 2, and so on.

Problem</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Today, nearly everybody wants to know which Erdös number he or she
has. Your task is to write a program which computes Erdös numbers
for a given set of scientists.

<p>

</p><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The first line of the input contains the number of scenarios.

<p>
The input for each scenario consists of a paper database and a list of names. 
It begins with the line

</p><p>

<i>P N</i>

</p><p>
where <i>P</i> and <i>N</i> are  natural numbers. Following this line are
<i>P</i> lines containing descriptions of papers (this is the paper database). A
paper appears on a line by itself and is specified in the following way: 
</p><pre>Smith, M.N., Martin, G., Erdos, P.: Newtonian forms of prime factors matrices
</pre>
Note that umlauts like `ö' are simply written as `o'. After the <i>P</i> papers
follow <i>N</i> lines with names. Such a name line has the following format:
<pre>Martin, G.
</pre>

<p>

</p><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For every scenario you are to print a line containing a string 
``<tt>Scenario </tt><i>i</i>" (where <i>i</i> is the number of the scenario) and
the author names together with their Erdös number of all authors in the 
list of names. The authors should appear in the same order as they appear 
in the list of names.
The Erdös number is based on the papers in the paper database of this
scenario. Authors which do not have any relation to Erdös via the papers
in the database have Erdös number ``<tt>infinity</tt>".
